### ðŸ“Œ FlightTester <br/>
Using the toSort() method the flight will be sorted based on the first letter of the flight number. This displays the pre-sorted and sorted flight information.

### 1. Description of the project<br/>
The java file aims to create a Flight class that will store various flight details such as; airline name, flight number, origin, destination, available seats, airfare, departure time, arrival time, and distance. This can sort and display them on the console, and create a form on a GUI. This shows implementation of class structures, arrays, sorting algorithms, and Java GUI concepts. 

### 2. Installation instructions<br/>
No installation necessary as this is a Java project. However, ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can compile and run the Flight.java, FlightTester.java and Form1.java files using any Java IDE (I used JGrasp) or command-line tools like javac and java.

### 3. Usage instructions<br/>
After compiling the Flight.java, FlightTester.java and Form1.java files, run the program. It will prompt you to input flight details and decide if you would want to sort them by flight number.
