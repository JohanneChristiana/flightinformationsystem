# flightinformationsystem
1. Clear and concise description of the project
The java file aims to create a Flight class that will store various flight details such as; airline name, flight number, origin, destination, available seats, airfare, departure time, arrival time, and distance. This can sort and display them on the console, and create a form on a GUI. This shows implementation of class structures, arrays, sorting algorithms, and Java GUI concepts. 

2. Installation instructions
No installation necessary as this is a Java project. However, ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can compile and run the Flight.java, FlightTester.java and Form1.java files using any Java IDE or command-line tools like javac and java.

3. Usage instructions
After compiling the Flight.java, FlightTester.java and Form1.java files, run the program. It will prompt you to input flight details and decide if you would want to sort them by flight number.
